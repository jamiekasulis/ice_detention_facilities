ice_facility_list_11-06-2017.xslx - raw file from National Immigrant Justice Center: https://immigrantjustice.org/ice-detention-facilities-november-2017

Three Python notebooks for an initial look at the data:
ice_data_exploration_us.ipynb
ice_data_exploration_new_england.ipynb
ice_data_exploration_ct.ipynb

It is recommended that, if you are perusing these notebooks, you start with the U.S. one. This one has a bit of the initial data questions
(i.e. what is the threshold for data suppression) that apply to the data in the other notebooks as well.
